# ENS-Data-Challenge

The goal is to classify product images into known defect categories or detect anomalies indicating process drifts. One of the main challenges is handling highly imbalanced data while ensuring reliable anomaly detection to prevent defective parts from propagating through production. This project is an opportunity to apply image processing and machine learning techniques to a real-world industrial problem, improving efficiency and reducing reliance on manual inspections.
This project is a work in progress. The code will be updated progressively.
